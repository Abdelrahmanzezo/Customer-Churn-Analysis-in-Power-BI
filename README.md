Objective:
Solving the customer churn puzzle at Databel, a fictitious telecom provider, using a detailed analysis of a churn dataset.

Overview:
In the overview section, I highlighted key KPIs like churn rate, total number of customers, and reasons behind customer churn. Leveraging Power BI, I crafted insightful visualizations to showcase the state of churned customers.

ðŸ“ˆ Churn Rate Analysis by Segments:
Diving deeper into the data, I segmented the analysis based on consumption patterns and unlimited data plans. Calculating average service calls by state and churn label provided invaluable insights into customer behavior.

ðŸ“Š DAX Magic:
I harnessed the power of DAX to compute average service calls, extra data charges, and international charges. The most crucial DAX calculation was the churn rate, shedding light on the churn dynamics at Databel.

ðŸ“‚ Age-Group Analysis:
To understand the impact of age on churn, I categorized customers into age bins. This allowed me to monitor the number of customers and churned customers in each age group.
